- 👋 Hi, I’m @BrendyRyan
- 👀 I’m interested in full-stack JavaScript. I'm self-taught, using courses from Wes Bos, Mosh Hamedani, Level Up Tutorials, Youtube, blogs, Google, Stack Overflow, and reading the docs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Svelte, Tailwind CSS, and Prisma. Also playing with the MS Office JavaScript API to run JS in Excel. It's neat!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... well anything!
- 📫 How to reach me ... message me on Twitter @Brendy_Ryan or email brendan.james.ryan@gmail.com
